# Ascii-renderer
An ascii renderer that loads in .obj files and displays them.

Compile as you would any C++ file. Run the binary and choose recommended parameters (you might need to fiddle in blender if the object isn't at the origin) and enter the file path. You should see the object spinning around. I have a few demo .obj to test with.
